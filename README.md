**Steps**
1. Choosing Dataset and Theme
Selection of the Sign Language MNIST dataset from Kaggle for the project theme.
2. Cleaning/Preparing Data
Converting labels to categorical for classification, performing Shapiro-Wilk test, preparing and revising EDA report, and reviewing existing literature on the dataset.
3. Initial Problem Analysis
Writing a literature review with a focus on the research questions rather than machine learning techniques.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Describing data, identifying missing values and outliers, analyzing attribute types, conducting descriptive statistics, box plotting for distribution analysis, and correlating attributes.
5. Feature Selection
Using a hybrid wrapper and filter approach for selecting the most predictive pixels, with a percentile-based cutoff.
6. Experimental Design and Cross-Validation
Statistically selecting 4-5 classification algorithms, including CNN, and explaining the choice of classification algorithms.
7. Predictive Modelling
Evaluating models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and a 25x25 confusion matrix; assessing models on stability, efficiency, complexity, and reliability; and performance evaluation.
8. Conclusion and Recommendation
Concluding the analysis and making recommendations.
9. Limitations, Future Direction
Discussing the limitations of the current study and suggesting directions for future research.
