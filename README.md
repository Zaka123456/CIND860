**Steps**
1. Choosing Dataset and Theme
Selection of the Sign Language MNIST dataset from Kaggle for the project theme.
2. Cleaning/Preparing Data
Preparing and revising EDA report, and reviewing existing literature on the dataset.
3. Initial Problem Analysis
Writing a literature review with a focus on the research questions.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Describing data, identifying missing values and outliers, analyzing attribute types, conducting descriptive statistics, class distribution analysis, and correlating attributes.
5. Feature Selection
Using a hybrid and filter approach for selecting the most predictive pixels, with a percentage based cutoff.
6. Experimental Design and Cross-Validation
Selecting six classification algorithms, including CNN.
7. Predictive Modelling
Evaluating models based on accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix; assessing models on stability, efficiency and effectiveness.
8. Conclusion and Recommendation
Concluding the analysis and making recommendations.
9. Limitations, Future Direction
Discussing the limitations of the current study and suggesting directions for future research.
